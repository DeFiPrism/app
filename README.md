DeFi Prism
==========
DeFi Prism is an alternative to centralized portfolio trackers. 

## Distingushing Features
The main benefits of using DeFi Prism are
1. Pseudonymous asset tracking 
1. Self-hosting
1. Community rewards
1. Transparency
1. Bug Bounty Program
1. Modularity


### Pseudonyomus Asset Tracking
Conventional account management systems require a username and a password
stored in a centralized database. DeFi Prism leverages "cryptographic login"
which requires a public-private key pair (a "shard") which is used to verify
identity and account details. No need to remember a password and we do not
control a database of users and we do not (and can not) limit account access.

### Self-Hosting
Most asset tracking products are accessible only through servers managed by a
single entity. DeFi Prism is built from the ground up using a reproducible
build system allowing you to easily spin up an isolated instance.

### Community Rewards
DeFi Prism is the first asset tracking product to provide financial incentive
for its users to contribute to the availability of the product. DeFi Prism is
offered as a subscription service. The fees collected from the paying users are
distributed to DeFi Prism "providers" according to smart contracts on various
L1 chains. In-built metrics ensure that a node that is unhealthy (unable to
process requests) or deprecated (running an older-than-recommended version of
DeFi Prism) receives less rewards than high-functioning counterparts.

### Transparancy
DeFi Prism is full open-source and uses, wherever possible, audited financial
and cryptopgraphic components. Users are encourgaed to submit pull requests to
change/improve the functionality of DeFi Prism. 

### Bug Bounty Program
The DeFi Prism core developers are obsessed with product quality and security.
We maintain an active bug bounty campaign to support the continual refinement
of the application.

### Modularity
DeFi Prism was built from the beginning to be chain and protocol agnostic. This
means that we can support tracking NFTs as easily as we can support tracking
BTC. Every asset tracked in DeFi Prism is available in the portal using a
combination of a data and view software component that instructs DeFi Prism:
1. What information is available to display
2. How to display that information
This architecture makes DeFi Prism extremely forward-compatible in its ability
to manage an arbitrary asset moving forward.
